    <h5>
	<font color = "purple"><font size="6"> Climate </font>
	</h5>
	<font color ="white"><font size="5"> The climate of Los Angeles is characterized by very mild and relatively rainy winters and warm and sunny summers; it is similar to the Mediterranean climate, but it is even milder. In fact, the city is located at a lower latitude than the Mediterranean coasts, so it has milder winters; on the other hand, it is located on the Pacific coast, along which a cool current flows (ie the California Current); therefore, summer is a bit cooler than in the Mediterranean Sea. So this is really a mild climate; moreover, it is kissed by the sun most of the year. </font>
